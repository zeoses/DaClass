# Matrix Simple Opreation (MSO)
this script is The Simple practice for module in python .
in this script we handel sum, scaler and transpose for matrix.

## How it works
You will see the following menu when running the script :
0 - Add/Change matrixs
1 - Sum
2 - Scaler
3 - Transpose
4 - Exit

### 0 - Add/Change matrixs
first insert row and column two matrix and after then insert matrix number.

 for sample :(a 2*2 matrix)

```python
matrix 1 :
1 2
3 4 
matrix 2 :
5 6
7 8
```
### 1 - Sum
The sum of the two matrices we entered in the previous step.
for sample sum of two matrixs:

```python
result :
6 8
10 12 
```

### 2 - Scaler
The multiply scaler of the first matrice we entered in the previous step.
for sample 2 * matrix1:
```python
result :
2 4
6 8 
```

### 3 - Transpose

The Transpose scaler of the first matrice we entered in the previous step.

```python
result :
1 3
2 4 
```

### 4. Exit
- Exit this script
